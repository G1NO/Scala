Scala Projects

I recently enrolled in a course called, "Scala and Spark for Big Data and Machine Learning." The course was taught by Jose Portilla, a highly recommended Udemy instructor. He works as the Head of Data Science for Pierian Data Inc. and provides in-person data science and python programming training courses to employees working at top companies, including General Electric, Cigna, The New York Times, Credit Suisse, and many more.

The course consisted of over 80 lectures and 10 hours of instrucional content. Since I already had a background in Machine Learning, the ML concepts were mostly review. However, the instructional content on the Scala language and how to use Apache Spark with respect to big data was my main reason for taking this course....and it delivered.

I was very pleased with how thorough the course was. It was fairly easy to get Spark up and running. Using the Atom Notebook with an attached Command Line interface, it was awesome to see the results of my Scala code show up in my terminal. 

I have to say that I really enjoyed learning Scala with Spark, and, I can't wait to dive into more projects in the future!
